This course requires the use of LockDown Browser for taking online exams. The computer used for taking exams must also have a built-in or external webcam. The LockDown Browser software prevents a user from accessing other applications or going to other websites during an exam. The webcam (Respondus Monitor) records you during the exam to ensure you're only using resources that are permitted. Together, these tools make it possible for students to take online exams from any location, and at times that are convenient. It also creates a fair testing environment for everyone in the course. Watch the video below for a brief introduction.

### You need to download and install LockDown Browser from this [link](https://www.respondus.com/lockdown/download.php?id=451214388){target="_blank"}. 
Note: Do not download a copy of LockDown Browser from elsewhere on the Internet; those versions won't work at our institution.

### Update required

- Once you have the LockDown Browser installed, launch the browser.
- Click on "i" icon at the top
- Click on the button that says "Check for newer version"
- Install the update

### Review this list prior to taking your quiz or exam:

- Ensure you are in a location where you won't be interrupted
- Turn off all mobile devices, phones, etc.
- Clear your desk of all external materials — books, papers, other computers, or devices
- No one else should be in the room with you
- Remain at your desk or workstation for the duration of the test
- Launch the LockDown Browser and choose Canvas from the drop-down menu
- Log in using your WSU access ID and password; navigate to your course
- Go to your Exam Content area and select the exam
- You will then need to review and agree to the Terms of Use for Respondus Monitor
- The Webcam Check will confirm that your webcam and microphone are working properly.
- The first time the Webcam Check is performed on a computer, Adobe Flash Player will require you to select Allow and Remember.
- The remaining steps of the Startup Sequence will depend on settings chosen by your instructor.
- Follow the instructions and note your progress along the top of the screen.
- If you encounter a problem, select the It’s not working link for troubleshooting tips.
- The test will begin after the Startup Sequence is complete.
- If an interruption occurs during the exam, briefly explain what happened by speaking directly to your webcam
- You cannot exit the exam until all questions are completed and submitted for grading.

Remember that you cannot take the exam using any other Internet browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.) besides the LockDown Browser and that you cannot exit the LockDown Browser until the quiz is submitted. Also, remember to save your answers as you go along the quiz.

We highly suggest that you use a wired Internet connection as opposed to a wireless one - if your wireless connection drops at all, you will get disconnected from the Canvas server and may have to have it reset by your instructor.
